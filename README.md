# Irish_Fest_visitor_insight

This project was for the Milwaukee Irish Fest to predict the demographics, tastes, and interests of the attendants. Surveys were conducted on August 17 and 18 by about a dozen researchers. There were 608 responses collected in a representative sample of the attendees. I was particularly responsible for collecting, sorting, cleaning and analyzing data collected through the surveys. A complete survey report visualizing the responses in included in this repository.

Following this project, I prepard a report which is guided towards allocating the marketing budget optimally using linear progrmamming in Excel. This report is included in the repository as well.

This project gave me an opportunity to closesly work with data through the whole cycle, starting from collecting the raw data to analyzing it using various techniques to discover business insights.
